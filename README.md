# django-html-modules

Reasoning
-----------

Django provides awesome `{% include %}` template tag. When creating a website there are some common things we need to display. For example
* Startup Pricing Information.
* Details of a Model Item - Must be shown in a nice box
* ..

This Project seeks to provide those commonly used modules for use.

Be Careful
-------------
I encourage all to not blindly use any of these modules. Download them, copy them, and modify them to fit your needs.
